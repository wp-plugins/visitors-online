== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get "Not enough rights to import from the GeoIPCountryWhois.csv file" error. What shall I do? =

You should set rights 755 to the folders wp-content, plugins, visitors-online and 644 to the GeoIPCountryWhois.csv file. In such case the plugin’s script will have enough rights to upload the file. Here is some useful information for you <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions#Shared_Hosting_with_suexec" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions#Shared_Hosting_with_suexec</a>.

= Where can I find statistics? =

You can see statistics on the admin panel, in any place of a post (if using shortcode), or in a widget (if this widget is added to the sidebar).

= Why do the number of users online displayed in statistics is greater, than it actually is? =

The user will be displayed online, if he/she had left the site, but the time when the user is considered being online is not yet passed.

= How bots are defined? =

The plugin receives data from the server variable $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], and searches the resulting value in its list of the most common bots. Once a match was found, the visitor is considered being a bot.

= Why the information about the day with the maximum number of visits does not match the number of actual visitors? =

The plugin counts the number of the site visitors during the day. If the same user visits the site 5 times during the day, the plugin see 5 visits, but not one. The visit means that a user enters the site or console as a guest user or bot, and stays within the time set on the plugin settings page. (The time period when the user is online, without making any actions).
